		\section{Introduction}
			Uganda is mainly an agricultural country and most of its revenue comes from the agricultural sector. Due to this reason, it is imperative to find new and innovative ways to improve on this sector. Improvements should include higher yields, resistant crops for example drought resistant and pest resistant crops.

			There are many ways this sector can be improved through computing methods. Some of those methods include sensors on the soil where the crops have been planted that can be testing the amount of water in the soil and whether the crops need to be watered.
